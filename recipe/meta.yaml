  summary: Make some beautiful corner plots of samples.

  description: |
    corner uses matplotlib to visualize multidimensional samples using a scatterplot matrix.
    In these visualizations, each one- and two-dimensional projection of the sample is
    plotted to reveal covariances. corner was originally conceived to display the results
    of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations and the defaults are chosen with this application
    in mind but it can be used for displaying many qualitatively different samples.
